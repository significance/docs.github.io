# Testing a connection with PingPong protocol

To check if two nodes are connected and to see the round trip time for message exchange between them, get the overlay address from one node, for example local node 2:

```sh
curl localhost:6062/addresses
```

Make sure that Debug API is enabled and address configured as in examples above.

And use that address in the Debug API call on another node, for example, local node 1:

```sh
curl -XPOST localhost:6061/pingpong/d4440baf2d79e481c3c6fd93a2014d2e6fe0386418829439f26d13a8253d04f1
```

# Generating protobuf

To process protocol buffer files and generate the Go code from it two tools are needed:

- protoc - https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases
- protoc-gen-gogofaster - https://github.com/gogo/protobuf

Makefile rule `protobuf` can be used to automate `protoc-gen-gogofaster` installation and code generation:

```sh
make protobuf
```

# Tracing
Developers can gain an additional level of insight into the node by enabling `tracing`. To make use of Tracing, we advice to make use of [jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/). 

- Set up tracing by:
  - Start jaeger:
`docker run -p 6831:6831/udp -p 16686:16686 jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest`

  - start locally two bee nodes (different data dirs and ports) and connect them (see "Start a private network" in the [tutorial section](/bee-docs/tutorial)) with `--tracing` flag provided for both nodes

- Make a call to the pinpong API on one of the two nodes (`curl -XPOST localhost:6061/pingpong/<overlay address other node>`).

Validate tracing in the web interface (`http://localhost:16686/`).
