## Download via browser
Downloading a file via the browser is very simple.

Use your address-bar to navigate to `localhost:8080/files/{reference}`. Where `reference` is the address of your file, which was returned when you uploaded the file. The file should be opened in the browser, or you will get a prompt to save the file (depending on the file-type).
